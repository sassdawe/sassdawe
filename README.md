### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒŒ My PowerShell portfolio is on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=sassdawe)  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
    - [DefenderASR](https://github.com/sassdawe/HardenWindows/tree/main/WindowsDefender/DefenderASR) as a pet project
    - [SPSFarmReport](https://github.com/sassdawe/SPSFarmReport), the goal here is to turn the original scripts into real publishable PowerShell modules
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PowerShell, as we all are
- ðŸ’¬ My thoughts are published at [kolislab.com](https://kolislab.com)
