### Hi there, I'm David, but I listen to Dawe as well 👋

- 🌌 My PowerShell portfolio is on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=sassdawe)  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    - [DefenderASR](https://github.com/sassdawe/HardenWindows/tree/main/WindowsDefender/DefenderASR) as a pet project
    - [SPSFarmReport](https://github.com/sassdawe/SPSFarmReport), the goal here is to turn the original scripts into real publishable PowerShell modules
- 🛠 I'm a SharePoint Server person which means `.NET Framework 4.8` and **SharePoint Designer**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PowerShell, as we all are
- 💬 My thoughts are published at [kolislab.com](https://kolislab.com)
